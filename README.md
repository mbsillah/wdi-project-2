# General Assembly Project 2: Georgia Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 Player Database
## Overview

I've played Marvel vs Capcom 3 since it came out in 2011, and I've always wanted a database of players to follow. This database allows the user to add players and pick there main characters for every fan of the scene to view.
